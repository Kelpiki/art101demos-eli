        <p>From here on out is a more official looking portfolio of which i've edited template html files from Art75.</p>
        <p>which might be from ~2023</p>

        <p>If it doesn't match the template (and you'll know if it doesn't), I either used Chatgpt to help code an idea I had, or its the bearest bones of a website(and you should def realize it was made by human hands)</p>
