            Interactive Web Narrative Project
        </h1>
        <p>For our first assignment you are asked to make a website that is a narrative/story/interactive visual story. 
        <p>Build and deploy a webpage to your GitHub account and submit your work as a screenshot and a link to the live site. Think about the poetics of the internet and what interactivity means to you. Can you make your div's links? Are you making drawings with your divs? Are you going to try it add some basic interactivity with JavaScript?

        <p>For this project I've decided my narrative should be coming up with the type of art I like or want to make in the future, or now. 
            I will tell you what parts should be future or now. Now might be more experimental. A sort of self discovery diary in 3 or more parts.
